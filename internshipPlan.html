        <h1><strong>Intership Goals</strong></h1>
        <strong><a href ="./index.html">Home page</a></strong> <strong><a href ="./internship.html">Internship plan</a></strong><br>
        For my study, I had to set up certain learning goals which I would like to work on during my internship. These will be listed here. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Manage & control | </strong>
        - During my internship, I want to actively work with a projectmanagement methodology.
            <i>At the end of my internship, I want to be able to show complete project documentation, about which I have receiver positive feedback. Feedback received during the internship has been applied.</i>
        <br>
        - I want to be able to perform extensive tests after designing a solution, if possible in practice.
            <i>During and after designing my solution, I want to test it extensively so that I can be sure that my solution works properly. These test results must be well documented so that they are accessible to everyone.</i>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Analyse | </strong>
        - I want to get to know a system or technology during my internship in order to be able to make the best choices about improvements / adjustments.
            <i>As one of the first activities I carry out in my internship, I want to get to know the system I will be working on, so that I am always informed about the requirements to achieve my goals.</i>
        <br>
        - During my internship I want to thoroughly research the information sources ashore in order to make good choices later.
            <i>Updating an ECDIS already has a number of ways to be done. These must be analyzed. The different suppliers must also be carefully examined to see if there are differences in their deliveries to customers.</i>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Advise | </strong>
        - During my internship I want to make informed decisions on hardware and software to use.
            <i>During my internship I will most likely need hardware (and maybe software). This must be bought and you want to make an informed choice about this. This way I can properly inform my project group about the technology that is being purchased.</i>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Design | </strong>
        - During my internship I want to take into account existing software and hardware solutions that are already active in the field of my assignment.
            <i>During the design of my solution, I want to make as much use as possible of existing solutions that already exist in order to avoid unnecessary / duplicate functionality. This is also described in our project plan. We must use existing interfaces as much as possible. Think of the network on board the ship, or a central data facility on shore.</i>
        <br>
        - During my internship I want to test my solution against the predetermined specifications, using a test plan.
            <i>A number of specifications come out during the inventory of the project; for example, the solution on board must be watertight. These specifications must be tested and a test plan must therefore be drawn up for this.</i>
        <br><br>
            <strong>Realise | </strong>
        - During the realization of my internship, I want to learn more about the programming language of the project (Java, C++).
            <i> We were already told by our internship supervisor that we will probably have to work with Java during our internship. This is a new language and for this I have to learn a lot about this language.</i>
        <br>
        - During my internship I want to learn how the DAB + data, when it arrives on the ship, can be used for the computers on board.
            <i>During the internship, a solution must be devised to receive DAB + at sea. DAB + can be received with a simple radio, but after that something has to be done with it. On board the ship, the information that is broadcast must enter the correct computer. For this, software and possibly also hardware must be put into use.</i>
