        The learning goals for this internship can be found <a href ="./internshipPlan.html">here</a>.
        On the 31 augustus 2020, I started my third-year internship at Rijkswaterstaat. Rijkswaterstaat is a branch of the Dutch government which is responsible for the maintanance of waterways, seas and roads. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Intro | </strong>The internship assignment I applied for concerns the way data is distributed on the North Sea. Right now, there is no reliable and covering network on this body of water, and Rijkswaterstaat wants to jump into this gap, as there is no financial insentive for a company to fix this problem.
        The goal of this assignment is rather simple: Improve the situational awareness of ships on the North sea. This requires data to be send too these ships, and that is where DAB+ comes in. A first step in this government project is transferring data and files with a DAB+ network. This technology was chosen because it has already seen widespread use since 1995, and is relatively affordable in contrast with for instance, satellite communications or a 5G network. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Use-cases | </strong>To test if DAB+ is a good choice for the transport of data on the North sea, a few use-cases have been formed. This was done before the internship even started. As the assignment is done with two other students, we each chose a use-case to start researching and implementing. I chose to start working on remote chart updates. Every ship in a certain weight class has to have an ECDIS on board, and many smaller ships use one, or a free version, for their navigation. You can compare an ECDIS to a TomTom in a car.  
        Most of these systems use a modified version of ENC charts, so these need to be transported via DAB+. This is where Chris Markus comes in, who is one of the two other students working on this assignment. He is responsible for transporting data reliably via DAB+. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Sending | </strong>The transmitting of a DAB+ channel is illegal, so to send data the project will be using a commercial DAB+ company, with a ready-to-use network. The receiver of this data will be build by the students themselves, both hard-and software. 

        From here, the proof and progress of the project will be documented.

        In the first few weeks of the project, we set up the contacts we needed for the project, did research about existing solutions for distributing data over DAB+. We chose the hardware we need to start the project, and met with Rijkswaterstaat employees and Broadcast partners.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Contacts | </strong>
        The project itself requires colaboration with a few external groups and companies, these include the KNRM, broadcast partners and shiptron. They each have a distinct role to play in the project. 
        The Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue Institution will work with us to test our project on the North Sea with their ships. The details will be talked about with them during the project.    
        Broadcast Partners is a company that specialises in FM and DAB+ radio transmission. They will work with testing our receivers, and in future projects, might be responsible for a network of DAB+ transmitters for transmission on the North Sea.
        Shiptron is our hardware supplier for the project. They will deliver products to us, at home due to Corona, and give us advice on what products to purchase.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Hardware | </strong>
        The hardware we need to test our receiver was decided in about a week, after we talked to our advisor and the suppliers over at shiptron. We decided to each get a <a target = "_blank" href = https://www.nooelec.com/store/nesdr-smart-sdr.html>Nooelec NESDR Smart </a>. They are cheap, have good documentation and work very well for how tiny they are. With this receiver, <strong>ANTENNA</strong>.
        We also decided to get a <a target = "_blank" href = https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one>HackRF one</a>. This piece of hardware can be used to be a receiver as well as a sender. This is a simple device to check if our software actually works before being able to send with Broadcast Partners. 
        To make a receiver that is able to be placed on a ship, or another object on the ocean, we decided to buy some <a target = "_blank" href = https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/?resellerType>Raspberri pi</a> with a decent case. This will be the base hardware for our receiver at sea. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Basis of the project | </strong>
        The only project that has worked with data over DAB+ before ours that we could find, is <a target ="_blank" href = https://github.com/Opendigitalradio/data-over-dab-example>data over dab</a>, which is a thesis by swiss students who designed programs to send and receive arbitrary data over DAB. We plan to use their work to advance our own project. This project however, has not been updated for years, and needs to be fixed.
        We could've also chosen to build our own software from scratch, but learning the DAB+ protocol takes a long time, as we heard from people online, aswell as from our partners.
