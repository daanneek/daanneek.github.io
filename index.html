		<div id="AboutMe" class = "AboutMe">
			Daan Nekeman is a computer science student who is extremely motivated to learn about everything to do with computers. Most of my time is spend learning about how computers work, and what I can do with different programming languages.

			Some of the technologies i've started working on/with are python, c#, asp.net, git, java and the MVC design pattern. What I enjoy most is finding the best way to write a piece of code.

		<div id="AboutPage" class = "AboutPage">
				When thinking about what this portfolio had to be, I went through a lot of designs, looking at examples and lists of other peoples portfolio's. I didn't just want to copy someone's elses work though. This is  also why I didn't want to use a template. Then I found a website that uses the desktop of a computer to display their ideas and work. I found this to be very creative and that is when I came up  with this idea. I'm not good at front end design at all and its not necessarily what I want to persue in the future. That is why I wanted to keep it simple, and this is the result of that search.
