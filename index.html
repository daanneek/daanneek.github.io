    <h2>About</h2>

<p>I was born in Spijkenisse, The Netherlands. Lived here all my life.<br></p>

<p>I'm an aspiring programmer. This website was my first concrete project, my other projects and assignments are on the bottom of this page.<br></p>

<p>I studied ‘Landscape and environment Management’ in Delft for a year but it wasn't really my thing, here I learned alot about studying and working together.<br></p>

<p>I was always way more interested in Technology. After researching Computer Science I was sold.<br></p>

<p>I haven't decided what kind of developer im going to be. Since starting last year i've been working on both frond-and back end, software and android development.</p>

    <h2>Future </h2>
<p>As I mentioned before I haven't decided what kind of programmer I want to become. I'm sure I will decide this well before I graduate, but up until this point I've enjoyed every language and project that I've worked on</p>
<p>I want to learn keep learning Java and Python. Java is needed for my current project, which is developing an android app. I will also have to get more familiar with XML. By means of this website I'm also learning how to use HTML,CSS and javascript for webdevelopment which I am enjoying. </p>
