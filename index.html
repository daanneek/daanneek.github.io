        <strong>About me</strong>
        <br>

       		Hello, I'm a computer science student who is, <em> as you can see</em>, very interested in back-end development. While studying computer science in Rotterdam I had to work on many different projects and assignments, working on websites, app development, sorting algorithms, concurrency and many others. My conclusion after working on these is that I do not like design, as i'm never completly satisfied with what I would design. 
       		<br><br>
            My internship will start in September 2020, I will be working at Rijkswaterstaat to develop an application to send location information to ships on the North Sea.  Progress can be found <a href ="./internship.html">here</a>.
            <br><br>

       		Now, as I mentioned in the little prologue up there, I went through quite a lot of ideas while developing my portfolio. I didn't really need it in the first 2 years of my studies, so I had a lot of time to <em>develop</em> it. It helped me decide what I want to do in the field of computer science. As while going through design after design for this portfolio, and designs for different projects, I grew frustrated with designing. 
       		<br><br>
       		I was inspired by <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a> and later on <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">Better Motherfucking Website</a> for the <em>'design'</em>, even though its almost solely plain HTML.

               <strong>Projects i've worked on</strong>
               <br>
            For most projects I work on I try to do more backend work, so its hard to showcase this code on this webpage. For most projects i'll provide the source code and a link to the github page
            <br><br>
            <b>>>></b>  I started off with working on small python projects to develop small algorithms and games, a good example of this is my first real project, a 4-in-a-row game with a simple win checking system and two player controls via the console.

            <b>>>></b>  As a networking assignment I had to develop a client-server system, to send simple messages between, for instance my laptop and desktop. This program works great and can be found below
            <br><br><a href="https://github.com/daanneek/ConcurrencyAssignment">Concurrency assignment</a>.<br><br>
            <b>>>></b>  This project I worked on at the start of my second year. We developed an app and a website for teachers and students. We got this idea because in our lectures at school, teachers would go around with a piece of paper to write down attendance. We developed a way where a student could use an app on their phone to scan a specific lecture's QR code and be specified as in the lecture. The teacher could log in to a site and check every lecture they have for the attendance. We also wanted to develop some algorithms to show statistics, but did not have the time for this. I worked specifically on the back-end and front-end of the website, ensuring the connection to the database/app.

            Some other projects I did can be found on my github pages aswell. If you have any questions about any of them, you can contact me at the links above.
