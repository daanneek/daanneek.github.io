    <h2>| About |</h2>

<p><div class = "ptext4">I was born in Spijkenisse, The Netherlands. Lived here all my life.<br></p></div>
<div class="arrow"></div>
<p>I'm an aspiring programmer. This website was my first concrete project, my other projects and assignments are on the bottom of this page.<br></p>

<p>I studied ‘Landscape and environment Management’ in Delft for a year but it wasn't really my thing, here I learned alot about studying and working together.<br></p>

<p>I was always way more interested in Technology. After researching Computer Science I was sold.<br></p>

<p>I haven't decided what kind of developer im going to be. Since starting last year i've been working on both frond-and back end, software and android development.</p>

    <h2>| Future |</h2>
<p>I want to keep learning Java and Python. Java is needed for my current project, which is developing an android app. I will also have to get more familiar with XML. By means of this website I'm also learning how to use HTML,CSS and javascript for webdevelopment which I am enjoying. By learning these languages I will also have an easier time with assignments from school. </p>
