	    <h1><strong>Portfolio Daan Nekeman</strong></h1>

	        Your first reaction to observing this beautiful website might be, 'Well, this is boring'. And you might be right, but after going through many options for this portfolio, this is the result.

        <h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>

       		Hello, I'm a computer science student who is, <em> as you can see</em>, very interested in back-end development. While studying computer science in Rotterdam I had to work on many different projects and assignments, the three major ones are web-development, app-development and software development. My conclusion after working on these is that I do not like design, as i'm never completly satisfied with what I would design. 
       		<br><br>
       		Right now, <em>Januari 2020</em>, i'm looking for new opportunities to learn about C#. I used the language quite a lot in school and from all the high-level languages i've tried, it has been my favorite language. For my internship in my third year I would like to work with C# aswell.

       		You can download my Cirriculum Vitae <a href="Documents/CVDaan.pdf">here</a> and my github page <a href="https://github.com/daanneek">here</a>.

        <h1><strong>Me and this website</strong></h1>
 
       		Now, as I mentioned in the little prologue up there, I went through quite a lot of ideas while developing my portfolio. I didn't really need it in the first 2 years of my studies, so I had a lot of time to <em>develop</em> it. It helped me decide what I want to do in the field of computer science. As while going through design after design for this portfolio, and designs for different projects, I grew frustrated with designing. 
       		<br><br>
       		I was inspired by <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a> and later on <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">Better Motherfucking Website</a> for the <em>'design'</em>, even though its almost solely plain HTML. 

        <h2><strong>Projects i've worked on</strong></h2>
        	For most projects I work on I try to do more backend work, so its hard to showcase this code on this webpage. For most projects i'll provide the source code and a link to the github page
