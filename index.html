    <h2>This is me.</h2>

<p>I was born in Spijkenisse, The Netherlands. Lived here all my life. Graduated high school in 2016.<br></p>

<p>I'm an aspiring programmer. This website was my first concrete project, my other projects and assignments are on the bottom of this page.<br></p>

<p>I studied a year before this CS year, a green study as I call it, called ‘Landscape and environment Management’ at Inholland Delft.<br></p>

<p>I stopped with this education as it didn't feel right to me. I wanted to 
learn a trade that I can actually use to create something. After researching Computer Science I was sold.<br></p>

<p>I haven't decided what kind of developer im going to be. Since starting last year i've been working on both frond-and back end, software and android development.</p>

    <h2>Future ventures (2019)</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before I haven't decided what kind of programmer I want to become. I'm sure I will decide this well before I graduate, but up until this point I've enjoyed every language and project that has been thrown at me.</p>
<p>For the rest of this year I have a few goals in mind that I'm going to try to reach before the summer, these include learning java while continuing to learn Python and C#. Java is needed for my current project, which is developing an android app. I will also have to get more familiar with XML.</p>
