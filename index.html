<p><div class = "ptext4">Welcome to my portfolio, I am Daan.<br>

I'm an aspiring programmer. This website was my first concrete project,
 my other projects and assignments are on the bottom of this page.<br>
I studied ‘Landscape and environment Management’ in Delft for a year but it wasn't really my thing,<br>
I learned alot about studying and working together.<br>

<div class="arrow arrow--up"></div>

I was always way more interested in Technology. After researching Computer Science I was sold.<br>
I haven't decided what kind of developer I'm going to be. Since starting last year <br>i've been working on both frond-and, back end, software and android development.</div>

    <h2>| Future |</h2>
<p>I want to keep learning Java and Python. Java is needed for my current project, which is developing an android app. I will also have to get more familiar with XML. By means of this website I'm also learning how to use HTML,CSS and javascript for webdevelopment which I am enjoying. By learning these languages I will also have an easier time with assignments from school. </p>
